            <h2>Jacobs’ Connection to 17 Story Street</h2>
            <p>Harriet Jacobs never owned 17 Story Street; she only rented it during her time in Cambridge.</p>
            <p>Today, a group of activists, historians, and residents—including Harvard professor Danielle S. Allen—are working to preserve 17 Story Street as a memorial and museum to honor Jacobs’ life and legacy.</p>
            <p>However, the property is currently privately owned by Janet Jiang, who plans to convert it into a high-end hotel.</p>
